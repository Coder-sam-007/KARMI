					<h2>MIGRATION AND LIVELIHOOD PROMOTION PROGRAMMES </h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Introduction :</strong>
						Agriculture itself is not economically viable and probability of drought has increased, employment opportunity in agriculture sector has become scarce. The other sources of employment opportunity also very less due to lack of industry and business sector. This has contributed a large scale migration to neighboring states and cities of Gujarat, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chatishgarh, M.P, Maharastra and other states. Similarly the intrastate migration also seen to Bargarh, Sambalpur and Khurdha district of the state to work as daily wage labours in different farms, industries, brick kilns, construction of houses etc. Drought also occurred every year regularly and failure of crops occurred every years. So the small and marginal farmers the youth of these families also migrated to the metro cities for searching of jobs. These are all seasonal migration and people with their families start migrating out from October –December and they come back in May- June to start agricultural activities in their own area. They are not migrating by their own wish but by force. KARMI also undertake the project “ Improving the Condition of Migrants in Kalahandi district of Odisha” with support of Jamsetji Tata Trust and has been working for the socio-economic development of migrants in Golamunda and M.Ramur blocks of Kalahandi.
