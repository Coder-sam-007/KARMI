					preservation of natural resource is too difficult. To keep close collaboration and create
					opportunity to createb lock level or district level forest committee. We organized two workshops on
					forest protection and collaborating to Govt. Through joint forest management and community forest
					management by formation of Vana Surakhya Samiti. Local Ranger and Forest Officers has been invited
					to these workshops and they shared the prospect of forest protection, Govt rules of JFM &CFM

					<span class="bold">Farmer's Training & Exposure :</span> Now a days there is a rapid depletion
					of forest and
					land due to
					high exploitation and somewhere not being properly use due to lack of proper way implementing
					technique. To proper use of it with eco-friendly manner by the people and save from devastation
					the concept of watershed should have develop in the mind of people in general and small and
					marginal farmers in particular. To improve the technique of cultivation, protection of forest
					and develop the idea of watershed KARMI arranged the farmers' training and exposure. In the
					reporting year KARMI arrange 2 nos. of farmers training Mahaling and Kantamal village where 153
					nos. of farmers attained. The potential farmers of our operational are also make two exposure
					trips to LOKDRUSTI Vaisadani Watershed.
