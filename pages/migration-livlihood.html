						<span class="bold">Introduction :</span> Agriculture itself is not economically viable and
						probability of drought has increased, employment opportunity in agriculture sector has become
						scarce. The other sources of
						employment opportunity also very less due to lack of industry and business sector. This has
						contributed a large scale migration to neighboring states and cities of Gujarat, Delhi,
						Hyderabad, Chatishgarh, M.P, Maharastra and other states. Similarly the intrastate migration
						also seen to Bargarh, Sambalpur and Khurdha district of the state to work as daily wage labours
						in different farms, industries, brick kilns, construction of houses etc. Drought also occurred
						every year regularly and failure of crops occurred every years. So the small and marginal
						farmers the youth of these families also migrated to the metro cities for searching of jobs.
						These are all seasonal migration and people with their families start migrating out from October
						–December and they come back in May- June to start agricultural activities in their own area.
						They are not migrating by their own wish but by force. KARMI also undertake the project “
						Improving the Condition of Migrants in Kalahandi district of Odisha” with support of Jamsetji
						Tata Trust and has been working for the socio-economic development of migrants in Golamunda and
						M.Ramur blocks of Kalahandi.
